##CRUD Application using Python-Flask-Restful, Angular JS and PostgreSQL

1. First, install -postgreSQL- and run it at localhost:5000.

2. I saved my database configurations in config.py file.

3. Migrate the models into the database.

4. Define Controllers for create, read, update and delete operations.

5. Run the controllers and check for desired output using postman.

6. Write Scripts to perform actions for front-end.

7. I have included a walk through video of my application here --> https://goo.gl/MBbOUg.

HAPPY LEARNING !!!
